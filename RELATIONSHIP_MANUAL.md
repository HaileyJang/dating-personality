# Relationship Manual Assessment

## Overview

This assessment measures three key dimensions of relationship behavior based on attachment theory and the Gottman Method research.

## The Three Scales

### 1. Attachment Style

**Scale: Anxious (-5) ← Secure (0) → Avoidant (+5)**

#### Anxious Attachment (Negative Scores)
- Seeks constant reassurance
- Fears abandonment
- Needs frequent validation
- Worries about partner's availability
- May be clingy or demanding

**Questions that measure this:**
- How you react to delayed responses
- Feelings about spending consecutive nights together
- Approach to vulnerability and sharing

#### Secure Attachment (Near Zero)
- Comfortable with intimacy and independence
- Trusts partner's commitment
- Can be close without losing self
- Balanced need for connection and autonomy

#### Avoidant Attachment (Positive Scores)
- Values independence highly
- Uncomfortable with too much closeness
- Prefers emotional distance
- Self-reliant in relationships
- May withdraw when things get "too close"

---

### 2. Conflict Style

**Scale: Defensive/Critical (-5) ← Healthy (0) → Stonewalling (+5)**

Based on Gottman's "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" - the four behaviors that predict relationship failure.

#### Defensive/Critical (Negative Scores)
- **Defensiveness**: Counter-attacks, "Yes, but..."
- **Criticism**: Attacks character, not behavior
- **Contempt**: Eye-rolling, mockery, superiority
- Escalates conflicts
- Focuses on partner's flaws

**Questions that measure this:**
- Response to complaints
- Reaction to partner's emotions
- What you need to de-escalate

#### Healthy Conflict Resolution (Near Zero)
- Takes responsibility
- Shows empathy
- Focuses on solutions
- Validates partner's feelings
- Uses "I" statements

#### Stonewalling/Withdrawing (Positive Scores)
- Shuts down emotionally
- Withdraws from conflict
- Needs space to process
- May go silent or leave
- Avoids emotional confrontation

### 3. Connection Style

**Scale: Turn Away/Against (-5) ← Balanced (0) → High Engagement (+5)**

Based on Gottman's research on "bids for connection" - small moments of reaching out.

#### Turn Away/Against (Negative Scores)
- **Turn Away**: Ignores bids (grunt, barely look up)
- **Turn Against**: Rejects bids ("Can't you see I'm busy?")
- Dismissive of partner's attempts to connect
- Misses opportunities for intimacy
- Low emotional availability

**Questions that measure this:**
- Response to interruptions
- Desire to know partner's inner world
- Engagement with small moments

#### Balanced Connection (Near Zero)
- Responds to bids appropriately
- Maintains healthy boundaries
- Engaged but not enmeshed
- Knows when to connect and when to give space

#### High Engagement (Positive Scores)
- Highly responsive to all bids
- Seeks deep emotional intimacy
- Wants to know everything
- May be intense in connection
- Prioritizes emotional closeness

## Interpreting Results

### Example Result

```json
{
  "attachment": -1.67,
  "conflict": 1.33,
  "connection": 0.5
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Attachment (-1.67)**: Slight anxious lean, but mostly secure
- **Conflict (1.33)**: Mild tendency to withdraw during conflicts
- **Connection (0.5)**: Balanced, slightly engaged

### What This Means

This person:
- Has a generally secure attachment but may occasionally seek reassurance
- Handles conflicts fairly well but may need space when overwhelmed
- Is responsive to connection bids with good boundaries

### Relationship Implications

**Strengths:**
- Mostly secure attachment provides relationship stability
- Balanced connection style prevents enmeshment or distance
- Aware of need for space during conflicts

**Growth Areas:**
- Work on staying present during heated conflicts
- Practice self-soothing when anxious feelings arise
- Communicate need for space before withdrawing

## Research Background

### Attachment Theory
Developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, attachment theory describes patterns of relating formed in childhood that carry into adult relationships.

**Key Research:**
- Hazan & Shaver (1987): Adult romantic attachment
- Bartholomew & Horowitz (1991): Four-category model
- Mikulincer & Shaver (2007): Attachment in adulthood

### Gottman Method
Dr. John Gottman's 40+ years of research identified specific behaviors that predict relationship success or failure.

**Key Findings:**
- The "Four Horsemen" predict divorce with 90%+ accuracy
- Turning toward bids for connection predicts relationship satisfaction
- 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions in healthy relationships

**Key Research:**
- Gottman & Levenson (1992): Marital interaction patterns
- Gottman et al. (1998): Predicting divorce
- Driver & Gottman (2004): Daily marital interaction

## Limitations

1. **Self-Report Bias**: Answers reflect self-perception, not objective behavior

4. **Snapshot in Time**: Patterns can change with awareness and work
5. **Cultural Factors**: Norms vary across cultures

## Technical Notes

### Scoring Algorithm

1. Each answer assigns a value from -5 to +5 on its scale
2. Values are summed for each scale
3. Totals are divided by number of questions in that section
4. Final score is the average position on each scale

### Thresholds

- **Secure/Healthy/Balanced**: -2 to +2
- **Anxious/Defensive/Turn Away**: < -2
- **Avoidant/Stonewalling/High Engagement**: > +2

These thresholds create three zones on each scale for clear interpretation.
