## Compatibility Patterns

### Highly Compatible

3. **SHE + SHE** - Two deeply engaged secure people
4. **XHB + SHB** - Anxious with secure (if anxious person is working on it)

### Challenging But Workable

1. **XHB + VHB** - Classic anxious-avoidant (but both healthy in conflict)
2. **SDB + SHB** - One defensive, one secure (can balance)
3. **SWB + SHE** - Withdrawer with engager (needs communication)

### High Conflict Potential

1. **XDE + VWT** - Anxious pursuer + extreme avoidant
2. **XDT + XDE** - Two anxious defensive people
3. **VWT + VWT** - Two extreme avoidants (no connection)
4. **XDE + XDE** - Two anxious defensive people (volatile)

### The "Anxious-Avoidant Trap"

**X__ + V__** patterns often create the classic "protest polka":
- Anxious person pursues
- Avoidant person distances
- Anxious person pursues harder
- Avoidant person distances more
- Cycle escalates

**Breaking the pattern requires:**
- Anxious person: Self-soothe, give space
- Avoidant person: Move toward, communicate needs
- Both: Therapy (EFT or attachment-focused)
